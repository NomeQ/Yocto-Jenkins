Setting up Yocto-Jenkins
************************

1. Download the yocto-jenkins files to your Jenkins home directory
   (On most unix systems, this will be /var/lib/jenkins), or clone it
   from GitHub into your Jenkins workspace from:
   git@github.com:nome-codes/Yocto-Jenkins.git

2. jenkinsBuild.sh will automatically download the autobuilder buildsteps
   from the git.yoctoproject.org site using the buildstep-tool. To use a 
   different buildstep repository, run the script manually with:
      
        > ./buildstep-tool.sh /some/directory/here

3. In Jenkins > Project Name > configuration, click 'Add build step' and
   choose 'Execute shell'

4. For the Command, enter:
    
        #!/bin/bash
        $JENKINS_HOME/jenkinsBuild.sh [buildsteps] [kwargs]

        e.g. .../jenkinsBuild.sh HelloWorld firstname=Nome lastname=Dickerson

   Note: Steps will be executed in the order they are passed in. Also, 
         the path will be different if Jenkins is cloning yocto-jenkins:

	$WORKSPACE/SOME_SUB_DIRECTORY/jenkinsBuild.sh ...

5. Build the project


Creating Custom Buildsteps
**************************

1. Add your buildstep to the buildsteps folder within yocto-jenkins

2. The current implementation is based entirely on compatibility with autobuilder
   buildsteps, thus each step is assumed to receive the parameters factory and
   argdict. Factory will always be given the value None. To change this default 
   behavior, modify the file 'buildSteps.py'. 

3. To import the yocto-jenkins stub library, use:
         from jenkinsBuildSteps.stubs import *

   You can create shell commands by subclassing the ShellCommand class, which will
   run a string given as the self.command field within a shell process with a 
   timeout. New buildsteps should also include a name field, which is used to 
   provide more descriptive output in the logs.

Version Notes
*************

-This is the initial version of this project. It is not yet compatible with the majority
 of autobuilder buildsteps.
